# Tommy P. Keane 🥦 👻 🐰

### Hiya! 👋

This is the personal GitHub account of me, Tommy P. Keane, a vegan Software Engineer / Data Scientist / Platform Engineer (DevOps) / Machine Learning Engineer (MLOps) / Cloud Systems Architect.

If you're lookin' for a famous Tommy P. Keane, that is most definitely not me.

However, if the Tommy P. Keane that you're lookin' for is a rambly, mumbly, nerdy person born in the mid-1980s in the United States of America, then you're probably at the right place.
